            Hi ðŸ‘‹ <br />
            I'm an Italian software engineer moving pixels in the world wide
            web. <br />
            With 8+ years in the field, I've worn many hats - from crafting
            high-traffic platforms to building open source solutions used by
            thousands of users worldwide. <br />
            Always seeking opportunities to create meaningful impact through
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I've worked across both open source and enterprise
            environments - from community-driven development at{" "}
            <a href="https://www.arduino.cc" target="_blank">
              Arduino
            </a>{" "}
            to building solutions for global companies at{" "}
            <a href="https://www.frogdesign.com" target="_blank">
              frog design
            </a>
            . These diverse experiences shaped my approach to software
            development, leaving me with a soft spot for open source and a knack
            for tackling complex business challenges.
          </p>
