      They partnered with frog (the company I currently work for) to redesign and implement the entire ecosystem of web and mobile apps.
      Which was done by creating a whole new Design Language System (DLS).

        body:
          The newly desigend DLS needed to be translated into code and implemented across three different touchpoints.
          A mobile app and two websites (one for businesses and one for customers). To do so we created a react component
          based library and used it to create the three backend driven touchpoints.
      - category: My role
        body:
          In a team made mostly of contractors, I was the only in house front-end developer working on the websites.
          As such I was in charge of enforcing best practices, writing code reviews,
          and working with the designers to avoid inconsistencies and make the life of my team easier.
      - category: Architecture
        body:
          "The app and the websites were built in a monorepo using respectively react native and react.js so that they could share most of
          the logic, hooks, state management, types, epics etc..


          In order to also share the components across the websites we built a component library in react and documented it with Storybook.


          Each one of the two website is divided into two main sections: a brochure section and a dashboard section.


          The first one is almost entirely stateless, backend driven, and server side rendered.
          The dashboard is the section of the website where the user can interact with STC services."
