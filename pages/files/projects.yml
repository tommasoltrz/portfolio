      They partnered with frog (the company I currently work for) to redesign
      and implement the entire ecosystem of web and mobile apps. Which was done
      by creating a whole new Design Language System (DLS)."

      - category: Objectives
        body:
          The newly desigend DLS needed to be translated into code and implemented
          across three different touchpoints. A mobile app and two websites (one
          for businesses and one for customers). To do so we created a react
          component based library and used it to create the three backend driven
          touchpoints.
      - category: My role
        body:
          In a team made mostly of contractors, I was the only in house front-end
          developer working on the websites. As such I was in charge of
          enforcing best practices, writing code reviews, and working with the
          designers to avoid inconsistencies and make the life of my team
          easier.
      - category: Architecture
        body: >-
          The app and the websites were built in a monorepo using respectively
          react native and react.js so that they could share most of the logic,
          hooks, state management, types, epics etc..


          In order to also share the components across the websites we built a component library in react and documented it with Storybook.


          Each one of the two website is divided into two main sections: a brochure section and a dashboard section.


          The first one is almost entirely stateless, backend driven, and server side rendered. The dashboard is the section of the website where the user can interact with STC services.
    stack:
      - React
      - Redux
      - SCSS
      - Storybook
      - Typescript
      - i18n

      "#### Frog Design went through a big rebranding, and put a lot of
      emphasis on its taglines: ***Make Your Mark*** and ***Make Bolder
      Choices***. The new design reflect these concepts by using bright colors
      and strong animations."

      - category: In a nutshell
        body: >-
          The existing website was too vast to be updated all at once. So the
          new design was created in modules that could slowly replace the
          existing sections. Moreover it also allow new pages to be created
          almost entirely from the backend (wordpress) without having to touch
          the code base.


          The project led up to the big launch of the key pages of the website, including the home one.
      - body:
          As the only developer on this project, I worked closely with the designers
          informing them of opportunities and limitations of the stack, and
          prototyping animations and interactions. I then took care of the
          implementation on both the front-end and the back-end.
