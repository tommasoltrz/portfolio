Currently working at [frog](https://www.frogdesign.com/)."

  I have 5+ years of experience developing digital products with a big focus on
  design systems and end-to-end product experience. I enjoy implementing complex UI while keeping an eye on usability and accessibility.

  Over the past few years I developed several web applications for some of the worldâ€™s largest Telcom, Fintech and Healtcare companies.


  I started my career as a graphic designer to then realise I was much better at writing code than I was at choosing fonts. I later worked for [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/),
  where beside doing web dev I would also write [libraries](https://github.com/CasaJasmina/TelegramBot-Library) and tutorials of [questionable taste](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arduino/pavlov-s-cat-7e6577?ref=user&ref_id=65561&offset=3) for thousands of users. The eperience left me
  with a soft spot for open source projects and well written documentation.
